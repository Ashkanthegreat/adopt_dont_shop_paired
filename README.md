Adopt Don't Shop is a website to streamline the adoption process. We host an index of shelters and their pets. Users are able to add/remove shelters and pets as well as review and rate shelters. If a user is interested in a specific pet, they can favorite that pet. When returning to the site we store user's favorited pets in a sessions, so they have quick and easy access to pets they may want to adopt. From the Favorited pet list, users are able to apply to adopt pets they are interested in. 

## Architecture 
  This website is built with Ruby on Rails. 
  We utilize the MVC architecture to organize our code. 
  Front end makes heavy use of ActionView Helpers to build out the site's HTML
